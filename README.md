## Features

### Implemented Features


### Future Features
- **Manage Availability** was dropped from this project as I didn't have time to work out the logic.  If given more time, manage availability would have been a 2nd option on the main menu and quit would be 3rd. Users would be able to set the days they were available to walk dogs. So that the spreadsheet owner would not have to manage that functionality.

## Design Documents

I made an original project plan as seen in this flow chart, but it turned out to be really complicated and needed far more time than I had, so I scaled back and adjusted to scale as I coded.

    - I used `# noqa` to avoid flake8 errors around lines too long where I couldn't rearrange the code to make it work. 
    - I also had to remove some extra spaces and the unused datetime import.

## Deployment

This application will be deployed via [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

1. Log into Heroku.

2. Navigate to Dashboard. 

3. Click "New" and select "create new app" from the drop-down menu. This is found in the upper right portion of the window. Provide a name for your application, this needs to be unique, and select your region.

![Heroku step1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163655564-83cb284c-310c-41c7-a13d-fe0f77bd14ad.PNG)

4. Click "Create App".

5.	Navigate to "Settings" and scroll down to "config vars".
6. Click "Reveal Config Var", in the field key I entered the CREDS word and in the value field I copied my creds.json content as past there.

7. Then scroll down to "build packs", click "build packs" and then click both "python" and "node.js"(node.js is needed for the mock terminal.)
![Heroku step3 - buildpacks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163655690-10a1a530-46ef-4d8d-a097-f27ba6cecfae.PNG)

8. Navigate to the "Deploy" section.

9. Scroll down to "Deployment Method" and select "GitHub".

10. Authorise the connection of Heroku to GitHub.

11. Search for your GitHub repository name, and select the correct repository.

12. For Deployment there are two options, Automatic Deployments or Manual, I chose Automatic Deployment so Heroku will re-build each time code is pushed to GitHub.

13. Ensure the correct branch is selected "master/Main", and select the deployment method that you desire.
