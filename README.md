# Project 3 Python Essentials: Dogs-in-the-hood

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163656132-b9347d81-103d-4c75-a8a1-5749e4b7ee7d.png)

Dogs-in-the-hood is an online app to connect dog owners and dog walkers in the same neighbourhood. It is for people in the community to easily find and coordinate to meet dog walking demands. The app contains a function that allows users to either log-in or create a new account to use the app. The app is supported by a Google sheet behind the scence, that is populated with the information entered by users when they register and use the app.

## How to Use

To start, users are presented with a short introduction and can either log-in as already signed-up users or create a new account. For ease, users are requested to type in  1 (then the ENTER key) to log-in or 2 ( then the ENTER key) to create an account.

To log-in, users are requested to type in their email address.
To create an account, users are requested to type in their first and last names, their email address, and a password. The screenshots demonstrating these steps on the app site are shown below:

Once a new account is successfully created, the user is presented with clear instructions to input their availability for the week, select 1 for available and 2 for unavailable, as shown in the screenshot below: 


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163662410-db485e94-38ae-4d56-97c8-7bfdcfc40e3e.png)



- After submitting their availability for the week, the new user is presented with two options: 1 - Select a dog walker or 2 - Quit the app:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163658789-5115418d-ed04-401e-a27d-9ef36b3b08fc.png)


- If user selects to book a dog walker with option 1, they then proceed to indicate what day of the week (Monday - Sunday) they would like with corresponding numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, as seen in the screenshot below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163658983-04f5e6fc-4f39-4816-b6a8-8307f5315b9d.png)


- User is now presented with a list of available walkers for their selected day, as shown below:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163659111-ed26082a-f773-4d40-afbe-34eee0290116.png)



Once they enter which dog walker they would like on a selected day, they receive a confirmation wihtin seconds, together with an update of their calendar showing their confirmed bookings and outstanding availability. See screenshot below:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163659220-b9fb1996-3213-4f80-bbd8-7b068a558e21.png)



In the above screenshot, it shows that after the update, the user is again presented with two new options. Option 1 is to find a dog walker for another day and option 2 is to quit the app.
If the user selects to quit the app at this point, they receive a 'Thank you and goodbye' message, as shown in the screenshot below:

- Shows the message 'Thank you for using dogs-in-the-hood. Goodbye!' when user selects option 2 to Quit.


* SPECIAL FEATURE
- With my mentor Malia's guidance, found a way to code special feature to prevent the app from accepting double bookings.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163661635-5e75619d-cd6d-43b9-9464-6641fd1c1f43.png)

- For example, in the above screenshot, user Emma was unable to book a dog walk for Monday as she was already booked. The message: " You will have to email Joe Jonas to cancel" was returned with an update of Emma's calendar for the week.


### Future Features
- **Manage Availability** was dropped from this project as I didn't have time to work out the logic.  If given more time, manage availability would have been a 2nd option on the main menu and quit would be 3rd. Users would be able to set the days they were available to walk dogs. So that the spreadsheet owner would not have to manage that functionality.

## Design Documents

I made an original project plan as seen in this flow chart, but it turned out to be really complicated and needed far more time than I had, so I scaled back and adjusted to scale as I coded.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163657194-a1d0eb32-8101-403b-8415-2ae40541a612.png)


## Data Model

## Google Sheet
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163656457-6bc38e8d-fabd-457a-aab8-7677b4ea05fa.png)

- When a user is registered their information is automatically entered on the spreadsheet.
- Website owner manually enters 'Available' for every day of the week before bookings begins.

## Testing

### Validation Testing

* PEP 8
        
    - I used `# noqa` to avoid flake8 errors around lines too long where I couldn't rearrange the code to make it work. 
    - I also had to remove some extra spaces and the unused datetime import.
    ![PEP8 all ok](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163655398-b5dee422-e198-4021-8c4d-e82b5dd8bdf3.PNG)


### Manual Testing
* On the main menu, I manually the following on the app:

1. On the main menu, what happens when an invalid email address is entered? See the screenshot of the result below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163665076-3250c3a3-4ef0-4f12-a8a2-cce77591ca6a.png)

An error message is returned to the user, with a request to try entering the email address again.
When a valid email format is entered with the next attempt, the programme recognises and the correct format and runs as it should:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163665235-85dc47cc-154a-410a-b2a9-27824d7c46ac.png)


2. To book a dog walk, what happens if I enter a number outside the numbers 1-7 corresponding to days of the week as instructed on the app, for example if I enter the number 8?:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163665427-d8a35f2e-1a73-42af-891c-009810bca7c5.png)

An error message occurs with the statement "Please choose one of the option" and lists the options 1-7 again.
When I proceed to enter the valid number 2, the app works and generates the next stage, see the screenshot below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163665527-b2e2fcd6-3ca0-48d4-8ee3-29588df9ee54.png)

3. Testing revealed coding issues for generating the list of people available to walk dogs on a selected day. The programme is coded to know when the user selects an option that is not on the list, by entering a number greater than the listed number of options. Please see the screenshot below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163666081-4a3e967f-b14d-4d4c-b8de-4134887f2633.png)

In the image above, the programme presents the user with a list of avialable dog walkers for Tuesday, all ranging from numbers 1-20 inclusive.
When the user enters the number 22, which is greater that the number of options, an error message occurs producing the only valid numbers in single quote marks ' ', and request that the userselects from the listed options. Please see in the screenshote below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163666256-f9be5b36-69a0-4364-8d7a-f6e936723d5a.png)

## Deployment

This application will be deployed via [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

1. Log into Heroku.

2. Navigate to Dashboard. 

3. Click "New" and select "create new app" from the drop-down menu. This is found in the upper right portion of the window. Provide a name for your application, this needs to be unique, and select your region.

![Heroku step1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163655564-83cb284c-310c-41c7-a13d-fe0f77bd14ad.PNG)

4. Click "Create App".

5.	Navigate to "Settings" and scroll down to "config vars".
6. Click "Reveal Config Var", in the field key I entered the CREDS word and in the value field I copied my creds.json content as past there.

![Heroku step2-config vars](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163655613-9aa8edaf-b1fe-43ed-a771-0a373ba4c3ad.PNG)

7. Then scroll down to "build packs", click "build packs" and then click both "python" and "node.js"(node.js is needed for the mock terminal.)
![Heroku step3 - buildpacks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163655690-10a1a530-46ef-4d8d-a097-f27ba6cecfae.PNG)

8. Navigate to the "Deploy" section.

9. Scroll down to "Deployment Method" and select "GitHub".
![Heroku step4 - connect to github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68662449/163655804-a9fb7b7c-ab21-4aaa-8b4d-e590f716b644.PNG)


10. Authorise the connection of Heroku to GitHub.

11. Search for your GitHub repository name, and select the correct repository.

12. For Deployment there are two options, Automatic Deployments or Manual, I chose Automatic Deployment so Heroku will re-build each time code is pushed to GitHub.

13. Ensure the correct branch is selected "master/Main", and select the deployment method that you desire.
